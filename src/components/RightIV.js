        <h1>Freedom of Religion (Articles 25‚Äì28)</h1>
        <p className="subtitle">Constitutional framework for religious pluralism and secular governance</p>

        <section>
          <h2>üß© Comprehensive Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Articles 25-28 establish India's unique model of secularism that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Guarantees individual freedom of conscience and religion</li>
            <li>Protects collective rights of religious denominations</li>
            <li>Maintains state neutrality in religious matters</li>
            <li>Balances religious freedom with public order, health, and morality</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Unlike Western secularism that separates religion and state, the Indian model promotes 
            "principled distance" - allowing state intervention to reform religious practices when 
            necessary for social welfare.

          <h2>‚ú® Constitutional Significance</h2>
          <p>
            These provisions serve crucial functions in India's pluralistic society:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Protect minority religions while preventing majority domination</li>
            <li>Enable social reform of regressive practices (e.g., temple entry movements)</li>
            <li>Balance individual and collective religious rights</li>
            <li>Provide framework for resolving inter-religious conflicts</li>
            <li>Support India's commitment to international human rights instruments</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Supreme Court has described secularism as part of the Constitution's basic structure that 
            cannot be amended.

          <h2>üìú Historical Context</h2>
          <p>
            The freedom of religion provisions draw from multiple influences:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ancient Indian traditions of religious tolerance (Ashoka's edicts)</li>
            <li>British colonial policies on religious non-interference</li>
            <li>U.S. First Amendment (Free Exercise Clause)</li>
            <li>Irish Constitution's religious freedom provisions</li>
            <li>Post-partition concerns about minority protections</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Constituent Assembly debates reveal intense discussions about:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scope of "propagation" rights (Christian missionary concerns)</li>
            <li>State's power to reform Hindu religious institutions</li>
            <li>Balancing religious autonomy with social justice</li>
          </ul>
