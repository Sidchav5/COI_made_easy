          The Constituent Assembly of India, formed in December 1946, was tasked with drafting India's Constitution. Comprising 299 members after Partition (initially 389), it included representatives from British India and princely states. Chaired by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, with B.R. Ambedkar leading the Drafting Committee, it held 11 sessions over nearly three years. The Assembly adopted the Objective Resolution (basis of the Preamble) in 1947 and finalized the Constitution on November 26, 1949, which took effect on January 26, 1950. It also served as India's interim Parliament until 1952. The Assembly's debates reflected India's diversity, resulting in the world's longest written constitution.
