          <p>
            Articles 19-22 constitute the fundamental right to freedom, encompassing both civil liberties and 
            protections against state oppression. These provisions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Guarantee essential freedoms necessary for democratic participation</li>
            <li>Create safeguards against arbitrary state action</li>
            <li>Establish procedural protections in criminal matters</li>
            <li>Have been progressively expanded to include various implied rights</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While Article 19 provides affirmative freedoms, Articles 20-22 offer protective safeguards, 
            together forming a comprehensive framework for personal liberty.

          <h2>‚ú® Constitutional Significance</h2>
          <p>
            These freedoms serve as the bedrock of Indian democracy by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enabling political participation and dissent</li>
            <li>Protecting individual autonomy from state overreach</li>
            <li>Balancing liberty with social interests through reasonable restrictions</li>
            <li>Providing safeguards against police excesses</li>
            <li>Allowing judicial innovation to address emerging challenges</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Supreme Court has described these provisions as "the ark of the Constitution" - essential for 
            preserving democratic values during challenging times.

          <h2>üìú Historical Context</h2>
          <p>
            The right to freedom draws from multiple legal traditions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>English common law protections like habeas corpus</li>
            <li>U.S. Bill of Rights (First Amendment freedoms)</li>
            <li>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)</li>
            <li>Government of India Act 1935's limited protections</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Constituent Assembly debates reveal intense discussions about balancing liberty with public order, 
            particularly regarding restrictions on free speech and preventive detention provisions.
