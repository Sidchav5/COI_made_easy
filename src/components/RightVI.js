        <section>
          <h2>üß© Comprehensive Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Article 32 establishes the Supreme Court as the guardian of fundamental rights by providing:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Original jurisdiction</strong> to enforce fundamental rights</li>
            <li>Power to issue five types of writs:
              <ul>
                <li>Habeas Corpus (produce the detained person)</li>
                <li>Mandamus (command public duty performance)</li>
                <li>Prohibition (prevent lower court overreach)</li>
                <li>Certiorari (quash illegal orders)</li>
                <li>Quo Warranto (challenge unlawful appointments)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Both curative and preventive remedies</li>
            <li>Remedy against both state and private violations in certain cases</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Dr. B.R. Ambedkar called this "the very soul of the Constitution and the very heart of it."

          <h2>üìö Detailed Article Analysis</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Clause (1):</strong> Guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clause (2):</strong> Empowers the Supreme Court to issue directions, orders or writs

            <li>
              <strong>Clause (3):</strong> Permits Parliament to empower other courts to exercise this jurisdiction (without Supreme Court exclusion)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clause (4):</strong> Specifies this right cannot be suspended except during emergencies (Article 359)

          <h2>‚ú® Constitutional Significance</h2>
          <p>
            Article 32 serves critical functions in India's constitutional democracy:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Transforms fundamental rights from paper promises to enforceable guarantees</li>
            <li>Establishes judicial review as a basic feature of the Constitution</li>
            <li>Enables public interest litigation for marginalized groups</li>
            <li>Acts as check against executive and legislative overreach</li>
            <li>Provides expeditious remedy compared to ordinary legal processes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Supreme Court has held that Article 32 is itself a fundamental right and part of the basic structure doctrine.

          <h2>üìú Historical Context</h2>
          <p>
            The right to constitutional remedies draws from:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>English common law writ jurisdiction developed since Magna Carta</li>
            <li>U.S. Constitution's judicial review established in Marbury v. Madison</li>
            <li>Government of India Act, 1935's limited writ provisions</li>
            <li>Post-independence concerns about state power abuse</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Constituent Assembly debates reveal this was one of the least contested provisions, with unanimous recognition of its necessity.
