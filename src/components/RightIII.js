            Rooted in India's social reform movements and colonial experiences:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>19th century abolitionist movements against slavery and indentured labor</li>
            <li>Gandhian campaigns against begar system and vethi (forced village labor)</li>
            <li>Work of reformers like Jyotiba Phule against caste-based exploitation</li>
            <li>Findings of Royal Commission on Labour (1931) highlighting systemic exploitation</li>
